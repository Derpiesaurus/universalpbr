This license is split into two sections. The first section covers the assets created and used in the "Universal PBR - Vanilla" resource pack, and the second section covers the assets created and used in the "Universal PBR - Modded" resource pack.
Asterisks (*¹, *²) mark further elaboration at the bottom of this license.

By using these assets, you agree to these terms:



SECTION ONE, "Universal PBR - Vanilla"

YOU MAY:
  - Freely use and modify the assets for private personal use (e.g. in Minecraft, as a resource pack).
  - Privately share the assets directly with individuals, as a whole resource pack or as individual textures (i.e. through DMs, Google Drive, Email, etc) without credit.
  - Include the assets as a whole resource pack or as individual textures in Minecraft servers and modpacks, as long as you provide credit*¹.
  - Use and modify the assets for use in other resource packs, games, animations, renderings, education, etc, as long as you provide credit*¹.
  - Port the assets to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. You may also publish and distribute this ported version publicly, as long as you provide credit*¹.

Without permission*², YOU MAY NOT:
  - Use the assets commercially.
  - Republish the unmodified resource pack or its individual textures broadly, or host it for general public download (e.g. uploading to Modrinth, CurseForge, PlanetMinecraft, etc), other than under the conditions specified above.
  - Use the assets in any illegal content or in a way that breaks laws.

ALL ASSETS USED FROM THIS RESOURCE PACK INHERIT THIS LICENSE.


SECTION TWO, "Universal PBR - Modded"

  Each asset in this resource pack inherits its associated mod's license. What this means is that for each mod that is supported, all of the assets included to support for it are under the same license that the original mod is under. 
  So, if you want to know what you can do with the assets in this resource pack that were made for each of the mods (that is, other than using them unmodified, as is, in Minecraft), please refer to the original mod's license here: (LICENSE LIST LINK)

  To give some context:
    I'm no lawyer, and I'm unsure if the many assets made to add PBR support to these mods would constitute derivative work or not. They're all made from scratch, but they all also require the original mods to function. The license of some mods prohibit derivatives. 
    I think it's the right thing to do to extend to this the license the creators of the original mods wanted their content to be under. And further restricting the assets in this license doesn't sit well with me if it's possible I'm violating someone else's license.
    This may be great, meaning you'll be able to use some of the assets commercially. However, it may mean that for some mods, those with no license, or an "All Rights Reserved" license, you may be able to do very little with those assets in this resource pack.
    If you are the creator of one of the supported mods and are interested in the assets made for this resource pack, or if you would like to discuss the removal of support for your mod from this resource pack, you're more than welcome to contact me*².



*¹ Credit may be given by name, ".derpy.", or preferably by linking the official download pages: its GitHub repository, or its Modrinth page (in the future this may expand to more sites, but this list is currently exhaustive).

*² You can contact me via:
   - Discord: .derpy.
   - Email: contact@derpy.info

  I'm happy to be contacted for any reason, including but not limited to: if you'd like an exception to be made to this license, if you have any questions or suggestions, or if you are the creator of a supported (or not) mod and want to get in touch.


ALL RIGHTS RESERVED UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED HERE.
THIS LICENSE, PRIOR TO THE RELEASE OF WHAT IT COVERS, IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE, AND IS LIKEKLY TO.
